## Overview 

This project began as research project for automated the recycle process in warehouse.


## Implementation

### Robotic Grasping Improvement Process

**1. Initial Setup and Testing**
First I downloaded the original model from the author's repository and 3D printed the gripper following the exact specifications from the research paper. I collected 50 grasp attempts using the recommended settings:
- Gripper force: 15N
- Approach speed: 0.1m/s
- Object: Standard 8cm diameter cup

**2. Initial Challenges**
The initial tests showed unsuccessful grasp actions due to:
- Limited training data (only 50 samples)
- Suboptimal gripper positioning
- Lack of environmental variations

Multiple test runs confirmed these issues:

**3. System Improvements**
To solve these problems, I made several adjustments:
- Expanded training dataset to 200 samples
- Added environmental variations (different surfaces/positions)
- Modified gripper parameters (increased force to 20N, adjusted approach angle)

**4. Successful Implementation**
After retraining with the enhanced dataset:
- Achieved reliable cup grasping
- Demonstrated successful cup rotation
- Maintained consistency across positions

**5. Final Validation**
Tested with various conditions:
- 10 different cup positions
- Multiple approach angles
- Different surface materials
Final tests showed 92% success rate:
