# About me

&emsp;&emsp;Hello! I'm Gary, and I'm a 17 year old from San Jose, California. I am a 12th grade student currently studying at Harker. Six years ago, I first started playing with robots. Six years later, I have designed and built competition bots with friends at school, worked on my own personal projects, and worked with professionals in the industry to fulfill their robotic needs. My work revolves around finding ways to use my skills in CAD design, coding, and mechanical fabrication to alleviate environmental ills. Feel free to take a look at what I've done in this site! 

# Internships

1. [**Futuredial Universal Robot Automation**](tech/fd-ur5-part1.html) - The market leading company that provides robot automation solutions for renewable electronics. I worked on a 6-DOF Robot Simulation and software control with an Optimized Path Algorithm and Computer Vision. 
2. [**OpenCV Ironoak Library**](tech/gsoc-2022-report.html) -  Through Google's Summer of Code program, I worked with developers from OpenCV to create a computer vision toolkit for FRC robotics teams with Python, Java and Linux.
3. [**Embodied Robot for Reverse Logistics - UMI**](tech/umi-2024-report.html) -  To utilize the Stanford Universal Manipulation Interface (UMI) robot to automate tasks in reverse logistics, such as sorting, handling, and processing returned goods in a warehouse.
3. [**Embodied Robot for Reverse Logistics- Aloha**](tech/aloha-2024-report.html) -  The core of the project is an embodied robot equipped with mobility and manipulation capabilities to perform various reverse logistics tasks. The robot uses sensors, cameras, and AI-based algorithms to identify and classify different types of returns, from packaging materials to defective or end-of-life products.
