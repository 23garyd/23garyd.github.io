# About me

&emsp;&emsp;Hello! Iâ€™m Gary, a 19-year-old sophomore majoring in Computer Science and Environmental Science at Dartmouth College, originally from San Jose, California. My journey with robotics began eight years ago when I first participated in FTC (First Tech Challenge) competitions, which sparked a deep interest in intelligent robots. During high school and college, I interned at a robotics company where I worked on projects involving papers from Stanford, including replication work on ALOHA and UMI. My tasks ranged from software debugging to data collection and optimization. Through my work, I aim to apply these skills to address environmental challenges. Feel free to explore my projects on this site! You can reach me at [garyding5678 [at] gmail [dot] com].

# Internships

1. [**Futuredial Universal Robot Automation**](tech/fd-ur5-part1.html) - The market leading company that provides robot automation solutions for renewable electronics. I worked on a 6-DOF Robot Simulation and software control with an Optimized Path Algorithm and Computer Vision. 
2. [**OpenCV Ironoak Library**](tech/gsoc-2022-report.html) -  Through Google's Summer of Code program, I worked with developers from OpenCV to create a computer vision toolkit for FRC robotics teams with Python, Java and Linux.
3. [**Embodied Robot for Reverse Logistics - UMI**](tech/umi-part1.html) -  To utilize the Stanford Universal Manipulation Interface (UMI) robot to automate tasks in reverse logistics, such as sorting, handling, and processing returned goods in a warehouse.
3. [**Embodied Robot for Reverse Logistics- Aloha**](tech/lerobot.html) -  The core of the project is an embodied robot equipped with mobility and manipulation capabilities to perform various reverse logistics tasks. The robot uses sensors, cameras, and AI-based algorithms to identify and classify different types of returns, from packaging materials to defective or end-of-life products.
